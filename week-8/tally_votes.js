// __________________________________________
// Refactored Solution



// __________________________________________
// Reflection
// 1. What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
// I learned that the for in loop is very useful for iterating over objects. This challenge has shown me that I need
// to do more research on how bracket notation works.

// 2. Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
// In the initial solution there were no new methods used.

// 3. What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
// During this challenge the idea of bracket notation started to become clear.
