<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site? I felt much more comfortable working on the actual challenge after going the Codecademy sections.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? There is a lot of information available online on how to use HTML5 elements. Having an idea now of what I want to search for make the researching aspect easier. 
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML). The only formating we used was div to center two sections on the page.
- What seems good and bad about HTML? Writing HTML is good because you can see changes easily by viewing the file in a browser window. The bad is getting use to the HTML document structure.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML. Every open tag needs to be closed. Be conscious of the document structure because it will make it easier to catch errors.
