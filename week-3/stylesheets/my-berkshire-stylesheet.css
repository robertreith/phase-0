/*
1. It is important to make sure you have the proper pathway for the stylesheet. If this is incorrect, the stylesheet will not be pulled to the html file.

2. Span helped get certain elements to do exactly what we wanted. It took a good amount of time with trying different code to get the site to look the way we wanted.

3. font-size, color, font-weight.

4. Classes and ids were added to the HTML file to assist with position in the CSS file.

5. I feel that our code was cleaner because we had it broken down into both an HTML file and a CSS file. It was easier to look through the two files we created to see how the page was structured.
