1.How do you define a local variable?
Local variables are nested inside of methods and can only be used in that method. Local 
variable start with a lowercase letter or an underscore (_).

2.How do you define a method?
A method is a task performed on an object in ruby.

3.What is the difference between a local variable and a method?
Local variable will not work outside of the method they are nested in. Methods can be used 
multiple time in the same code.

4.How do you run a ruby program from the command line?
To run a ruby program from the command line you use the command: ruby <filename>.rb.

5.How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?
To run an RSpec file from the command line you use the command: rspec <spec-file-name>.rb.

6.What was confusing about this material? What made sense?
The part that I got hung up on in this challenge was getting the RSpec to come back with no errors. 
I realized my error was using “puts” instead of “p” in my code. Once I change it out on the 2 
exercises everything was passing. Many of the string methods are self explanatory and easy to use.
