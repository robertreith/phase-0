1. A wireframe is a visual guide that shows the framework for a website.

2. Wireframing allows you to plan the layout of the site based on how you want the user to interact with it.

3. I did enjoy wireframing my site. Although my design is probably the most basic is could be, it let me visualize the layout.

4. I stuck with my original idea. Since I have never created a wireframe before, my logic was to keep it as simple as possible. Once I get a handle on the basics, I can always update my wireframe to be more creative. 

5. I wasnâ€™t sure which program would work best for me to create the wireframe. After going through the list of free wireframes, I chose to go with MockFlow because it felt the most user friendly to me.

6. I enjoyed learning the starting process of creating a website. Having never done this this before, I found it very interesting.
