1. The 6 phases of web design are: information gathering, planning, design, development, testing and delivery and maintenance.

2. My site’s primary purpose is to provide people with information about myself. It will feature an “about me” section, my blog, projects I am currently working on, and a “contact me” section.

3. My target audience interests revolve around being a beginner developer. This site will give a fellow beginners point of view to people interested in make a transition into the developer's world.

4. The initial intention of this website is to provide information to the user. As the site evolves, it will take on multiple roles from showcasing my portfolio to future employers as well as provide another means of contacting me. 

5. Some of the main things to know about design is make sure the target audience is being addressed. Also, when designing the website, keep in very good contact with the client. This will insure they are going to be happy with the end product. The important thing to remember about user experience is it’s how a person feels when interacting with the website.

6. User experience design the process of improving how the user feels about interacting with the product (website) and increasing that overall satisfaction. It is valuable because it will help increase traffic to a site and prove the user with a sense of satisfaction after visiting.

7. The part of this challenge I found tedious was getting my image to show in my file. I had to go through quite a few commits, making very small tweaks, to get it to finally appear.
