#  Reflection
# 1. What did you learn about making code readable by working on this challenge?
# Making the code more readable by refactoring is currently difficult for me because when I see working 
# code I donâ€™t want to break it. I learned that once you make the code more readable it will not only allow
# you to understand the code better but for others to understand it better as well.

# 2. Did you learn any new methods? What did you learn about them?
# I learned the has_key? method to check if the hash contains a key. This was useful when checking the
# hash to determine if the argument error should be raised.

# 3. What did you learn about accessing data in hashes? 
# Accessing data in hashes can be done easily and has many benefits. In this challenge using the method
# to determine if a key existed was very useful.

# 4. What concepts were solidified when working through this challenge?
# Different aspects of hashes were solidified. I also realized that I need to stop overcomplicating the 
# problem and work on readability and simplicity when coding.
