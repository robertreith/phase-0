# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
In this first assignment I chose to look into meditation and timeboxing. Meditation is a new to me and I feel that with learning something completely new like coding, also learning how to clear my mind would be a useful tool. After researching timeboxing, I realized I use this method in my everyday life. I set time limits on tasks and once the time is up I evaluate how much progress has been made. This will be a very useful tool in Phase 0 since I am a true beginner to coding. Setting a specific amount of time for tasks and evaluating the progress made, will help me create a gauge for how long certain things should take. I will also help me take a step back and make sure I’m progressing in the correct direction during these first 9 weeks.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
A shell is program that takes commands inputted by a user that the operating system performs. Bash is a Unix shell that is used on Linux and OS X.  The most challenging part of this material is that it is brand new to me. I have never used the command line so learning how to navigate is a tricky. I was able to successfully use all the commands in the “Command Line Crash Course”.  For me the most important commands are ls and help.

pwd - print working directory
ls - list directory
mv - move file or directory
cd - change directory
../ - go back to previous directory
touch - change file timestamp
mkdir - make directory
less - page through a file
rmdir - remove directory
rm - remove file
help - read a manual page

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
To fork a repo you first must find the repository you wish to make a copy for yourself. once this is found, click the box in the top right corner labeled “Fork”. This will create a new copy of the repo in your own GitHub account.

Cloning a repo allows you to put the repo on your computer for editing. this is done in the command line on your computer. The first step is to copy the clone URL link on the GitHub website. Next open your terminal and determine what directory you are in. Once you are in the directory you want to clone the repo to enter the command “git clone COPIED URL”. After the command prompt appears again enter “ls”. You will see the folder with same name as the repo you cloned.

Forking a repo is making a copy of an already created repo. This will allow collaborate with others on the same project.

I didn't struggle setting up git and GitHub. While setting everything up, I realized I’m becoming more familiar with the command line and I’m feeling more confident.
