# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
In this first assignment I chose to look into meditation and timeboxing. Meditation is a new to me and I feel that with learning something completely new like coding, also learning how to clear my mind would be a useful tool. After researching timeboxing, I realized I use this method in my everyday life. I set time limits on tasks and once the time is up I evaluate how much progress has been made. This will be a very useful tool in Phase 0 since I am a true beginner to coding. Setting a specific amount of time for tasks and evaluating the progress made, will help me create a gauge for how long certain things should take. I will also help me take a step back and make sure I’m progressing in the correct direction during these first 9 weeks.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
A shell is program that takes commands inputted by a user that the operating system performs. Bash is a Unix shell that is used on Linux and OS X.  The most challenging part of this material is that it is brand new to me. I have never used the command line so learning how to navigate is a tricky. I was able to successfully use all the commands in the “Command Line Crash Course”.  For me the most important commands are ls and help.

pwd - print working directory
ls - list directory
mv - move file or directory
cd - change directory
../ - go back to previous directory
touch - change file timestamp
mkdir - make directory
less - page through a file
rmdir - remove directory
rm - remove file
help - read a manual page
