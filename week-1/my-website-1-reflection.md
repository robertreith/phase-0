Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  To create a new repository on GitHub the first step after signing into your account is to click the plus (+) sign in the top right corner of the screen. A dropdown box will appear, click “New repository”. This will bring you to a new page where you name the repository, select the access of either public or private, and can add a license. After these options are selected, click “Create repository” at the bottom of the page.  Once this is complete you can clone the repository to your local computer. This is done by copying the URL link on the newly created repository page in GitHub. Open the command line and check which directory you are in using the command “pwd”. Always make sure you are in the correct directory before cloning the repository. Once in the correct directory use the command “git clone COPIED_URL”. To confirm the cloned repository was added, use the command “ls” to list the folders in the directory. The cloned repository should now show. 

Describe what open source means.
  Open source is the sharing of computer software with its source code available. This allows anyone to customized the program.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  I think open source is a great concept. It still gives credit to the original create but can allow a large collaboration of ideas. I see this a creating a better overall software.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
  The use of licenses are important because all work is different and require their own set of parameters of what should be done with the software. With less restrictive licenses, it allows the software to be used, shared, and changed by anyone.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  The concept of creating a new repository in GitHub and cloning it into my local machine was reinforced this challenge. I definitely feel much more comfortable using the git commands this time around and it feels like I’m actually grasping the concepts.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  I only used the resources provided in this and previous assignments to complete the challenge.
