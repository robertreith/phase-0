<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!-- # This challenge took me [#] hours. -->	
<!-- 1. What did you learn about the DOM?
I learned that with the DOM JavaScript can access and change any/all elements in an HTML file.
2. What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
Some of the useful methods we used were getElementById which allowed us to select elements with a predetermined “ID” in the HTML file. Also, getElementsByTagName allowed us to access the h1 tag. To access this tag the method needs to be followed by
a [0] to change the “first” or or 0 index h1 tag (ex. document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0]). -->
